The game support one or two players. Different types of questions will be given for students in different grades.

In the game, if both of two player do not make many mistakes and all get to the end of the game, the person who starts the game first will get to save the princess and win, and he wins by answering the very first question quickly. We got the idea from the online game “Soccer game” which supports two players.
